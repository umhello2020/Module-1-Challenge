# Module-1-Challenge

## Description
This project contains updated code improved from the starter code. I made the HTML elements more semantic to be more accesible for consumers. The title became more descriptive versus just website. The headers were moved into a more sequential order and the HTML elements into a more logical structure so it is easier for viewers to understand. I consolidated the CSS code to organize it better and make it easier to read. Here is a link to the deployed site-
